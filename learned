DAY 1 - Keyboard with sounds

- <kbd> </kbd> ; will make the letters look like it's a keyboard
- key.classList.add("newClass") ; will add a class without jQuery
- key.classList.remove("newClass") ; will remove a class without jQuery
- key.classList.toggle("newClass') ; will toggle classes without jQuery
- we can use the website keycode.info to attach every key on the keyboard and associate it with a number

	keys.forEach(key => key.addEventListener("transitionend", removeTransition))
- select all keys (node list)
- for each key, we will add an Event listener
- when the transitionend, execute the function "removeTransition"


	function removeTransition(e) {
		if (e.propertyName !== "transform") return; // skip it if it's not a transform
		this.classList.remove("playing");
	}
- if the propertyName of e is not transform, we skip it
- this ; if we don't know what it refers to, we can console.log it and it will say what it is

	audio.currentTime = 0; //rewind to the start
- this is for the sound to restart even if it hasn't finished yet
- we can restart the sound as many times as we want
